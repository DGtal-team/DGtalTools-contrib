# DGtalTools-contrib
Various tools from the community built using DGtal.


This project is actually organized as follows:

 - [Geometry2d](#geometry2d)

 - [Geometry3d](#geometry3d)

 - [Visualisation](#visualisation)



Geometry2d
----------

This section can contains various utilities related to 2d geometry (2d estimators, 2d contours tools, ...)  
Actually it contains this tool:

   - meaningFullThickness: to display the meaningful thickness of digital contour.


Geometry3d
----------

As the previous section but in 3d, it contains actually these tools:

   - basicEditMesh: to apply basic mesh edition (scale change, mesh face contraction, face filtering).
   - compareErrorMesh: compute hausdorf distance between two meshes.



Visualisation
-------------

This section, can contains all tools related to visualisation. 
Actually it contains this tool:

   - displayTgtCoverAlphaTS: to display alpha-thick segment given on a simple contour.
